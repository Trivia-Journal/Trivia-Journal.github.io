# "What is diffrence between Remote training and F2F training?"

F2F training stands for face-to-face training. It has opposite features and properties compared to remote training, ***such as e-learning and remote conferences.*** Remote training and communication have become popular since the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has been used in various industries despite the limitations and differences of each industry. The reason for this is that it reduces time and saves costs compared to face-to-face training.

Although face-to-face communication seems easy and uninterrupted, many people prefer to ***ommunicate, cooperate, collaborate, and train face-to-face,*** even if it requires spending more time and money. ==This is because the remote environment can be difficult to build relationships and effectively share experiences, unlike the face-to-face way.==

~~In the future, if the culture, thoughts, recognition, behaviors, and other aspects related to human beings become more convenient, face-to-face communication may not be essential anymore.~~ However, even if this happens, I believe that the remote way will remain an option in human life for communication, relationship, and activities with others based on human desires.
