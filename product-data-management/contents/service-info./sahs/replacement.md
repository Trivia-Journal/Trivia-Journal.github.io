<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### &#x20;   1-1. Components Affected

**SAHS Major Components** which will be mentioned in this section are selected based on the spare parts list that is listed by Seegene Inc., & Supplier.



### &#x20;   1-2. Summary

**SAHS Major Components** which will be mentioned in this section are likely a role to be involved in the driver part rather than the controller part.&#x20;

* **Driver part** mainly refers to the 'Motor(which includes the general type of gear & Pulley)', 'Sensor(which is emitting and detecting by the Infrared)', 'Injection Molding Fixtures', etc
* **Controller part** mainly refers to the 'PCB Assy(which has functions as processing, calculation, command, and trigger)', 'PID Control(which has functions to control the signal by 'Proportional', 'Integral', and 'Derivative'), etc

For the disassembling procedure, refer to the [#1-4.-disassembling-procedure](replacement.md#1-4.-disassembling-procedure "mention")

As for the reassembling & Alignment, follow the reverse order of that with a note for each step if alignment is needed.



### &#x20;   1-3. Recommendation

In terms of the technical service, recommend you to set the **Saving and Stock Plan called on Essential Spare Parts(ESP)** on your side to manage the general service quality & responsiveness to client needs.
