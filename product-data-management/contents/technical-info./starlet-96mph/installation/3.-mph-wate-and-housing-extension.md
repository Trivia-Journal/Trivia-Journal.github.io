### &#x20;   3-1. Units Affected

&#x20;       STARline instruments are equipped with Modular ARM (P/N 173050) & 96 Probe-Head (P/N ).

### &#x20;   3-2. Summary

&#x20;       Not all STARline instruments are equipped with the appropriate arm that can accommodate a 96 Probe Head. An instrument is eligible to have the Prep Arm Upgrade (which allows the addition of the 96 Probe Head) if it meets the following criteria:

* Serial Number is greater than 2000
* Serial Number is greater than A000
* Serial Number is greater than 000A
* The Current arm is part number 173050

&#x20;       Modular ARM (P/N 173050) already has the Prep Arm Upgrade added and no further action is necessary to add a 96 Probe Head.

### &#x20;   3-3. Recommendation

&#x20;       In order to successfully install the MPH Wate L Front for Modular Arm & Housing Extension MPH to the system that is equipped with Modular ARM (P/N 173050) & 96 MPH (P/N ), follow the section&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please keep in mind that we recommend assembling the outer covers above after doing the Macro Steps of the MPH to adjust its Y-Tilt.

As for the MACRO steps, refer to the section - [#1-5.-procedure-for-the-align.-and-cal.-for-the-96-probe-head](../adjustment/macro.md#1-5.-procedure-for-the-align.-and-cal.-for-the-96-probe-head "mention")
{% endhint %}



### &#x20;       **B. Mount the Housing Extension MPH**

1. Remove the Left Plexiglas Side Cover.
2. Remove the existing Front Side Panel Bracket not to interfere with the 96 Prep Arm & MPH.
