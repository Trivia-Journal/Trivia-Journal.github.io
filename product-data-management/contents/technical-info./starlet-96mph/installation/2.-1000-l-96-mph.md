### &#x20;   2-1. Units Affected

&#x20;       STARline instruments that are equipped with Modular ARM (P/N 173050) require a 96 Probe Head Upgrade.

### &#x20;   2-2. Summary

&#x20;       Not all STARline instruments are equipped with the appropriate arm that can accommodate a 96 Probe Head. An instrument is eligible to have the Prep Arm Upgrade (which allows the addition of the 96 Probe Head) if it meets the following criteria:

* Serial Number is greater than 2000
* Serial Number is greater than A000
* Serial Number is greater than 000A
* The Current arm is part number 173050

&#x20;       Modular ARM (P/N 173050) already has the Prep Arm Upgrade added and no further action is necessary to add a 96 Probe Head.

### &#x20;   2-3. Recommendation

&#x20;       In order to successfully install the 96 Probe-Head to the system that is equipped with Modular ARM (P/N 173050), follow the section - [#2-5.-1000-l-96-probe-head-installation-procedure](2.-1000-l-96-mph.md#2-5.-1000-l-96-probe-head-installation-procedure "mention")

### &#x20;   **2-5. 1000µl 96 Probe-Head Installation Procedure**

### &#x20;       **A. Mount the 1000µl 96 Probe-Head**

1. Before mounting the 1000µl 96 Probe-Head, assemble the Large Metallic Cover by tightening the screws (4ea in total).
2. Then, down to move the mounting plate of the Y/Z Drive until the bolt joints are shown manually by rotating the pulley of the Y/Z Drive.
3. Mount the 1000µl Probe-Head onto the Y/Z drive referring to the 4-bolt joints and Guide Pins. At the same time, tighten the screws (4ea in total).

{% hint style="info" %}
Able to check and set the DIP-Switches of PCB Assy(96 Probe-Head) shown below.

* Disassemble the PCB Assy(96 Probe-Head) by loosening the screws (3ea in total).
* Check and set the DIP-Switches depending on the type of 96 Probe-Head.
*   Refer to the figure shown below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please keep in mind that we recommend assembling the outer covers above after doing the Macro Steps of the MPH to adjust its Y-Tilt.

As for the MACRO steps, refer to the section - [#1-5.-procedure-for-the-align.-and-cal.-for-the-96-probe-head](../adjustment/macro.md#1-5.-procedure-for-the-align.-and-cal.-for-the-96-probe-head "mention")
