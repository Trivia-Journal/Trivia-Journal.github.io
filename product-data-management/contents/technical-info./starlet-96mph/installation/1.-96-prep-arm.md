# 1. 96 Prep Arm

## <mark style="color:blue;">1. 96 Prep Arm Installation</mark>

### &#x20;   1-1. Units Affected

&#x20;       STARline instruments that are equipped with Modular ARM (P/N 173050) require a 96 Probe Head Upgrade.

### &#x20;   1-2. Summary

&#x20;       Not all STARline instruments are equipped with the appropriate arm that can accommodate a CORE 96 Probe Head II. An instrument is eligible to have the Prep Arm Upgrade (which allows the addition of the 96 Probe Head) if it meets the following criteria:

* Serial Number is greater than 2000
* Serial Number is greater than A000
* Serial Number is greater than 000A
* The Current arm is part number 173050

&#x20;       Modular ARM (P/N 173050) already has the Prep Arm Upgrade added and no further action is necessary to add a CORE 96 Probe Head II.

### &#x20;   1-3. Recommendation

&#x20;       If all criteria are met above, a Prep Arm Upgrade Kit (P/N 67951-01) can be purchased to accommodate a 96 Probe Head. It is also recommended to order a LED Strip (P/N 186892) and double-sided tape (P/N 7281645).

&#x20;       In order to successfully add the upgrade kit to the existing system, follow the section - [#1-5.-prep-arm-upgrade-installation-procedure](1.-96-prep-arm.md#1-5.-prep-arm-upgrade-installation-procedure "mention")

### &#x20;       **E. Assemble the upgraded Prep Arm Assy, type for 96 Probe-Head**

1. Place the upgraded Prep Arm Assy on the existing left-side cable tray of the X-Arm Assy.
2. Then, tighten the screws(12 ea in total) slightly on both sides - Front & Rear - to fix it firmly on the X-Arm Assy.
