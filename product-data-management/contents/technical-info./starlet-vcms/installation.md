# Installation

## <mark style="color:blue;">1. Site Considerations</mark>

### &#x20;   1-1. Requirements

A stable, level surface that can accommodate the weight and size of Seegene Vial Cap Management System (VCMS) & STARlet.

Minimized exposure to direct sunlight, excessive vibrations, and fluctuating temperature/humidity.

Sufficient space around the instrument and VCMS for the controlling computer and other accessories.

A stable, level STAR instrument.

Keep the dimensions of the VCMS in mind before transportation.

Ensure the VCMS can be safely installed at the designated location.

Avoid moving the VCMS once installed and calibrated, as it will have to be re-calibrated after it has been moved.

## <mark style="color:blue;">4. Preparing the STARlet</mark>

### &#x20;   4-1. Procedure

1. Check the location of the instrument that will integrate with the VCMS. Double-check that the STAR is level.
2. The VCMS occupies 91.5cm to the left of the STARlet, 2cm behind, and 4.5cm beyond the loading table.
3. Remove the left side of the STARlet's enclosure. Remove two M4 Screws indicated in the image below. (Keep the polycarbonate sheet in case of uninstallation)
4. Attach the wingnut screw into the rear carrier detection block on the 2nd track position. Leave plenty of thread on the screw, as it will be used to locate and fix the VCMS baseplate to the deck.
5. Install the new side panel as below. Secure it using the same two M4 Screws.



## <mark style="color:blue;">5. Integrating the VCMS</mark>

### &#x20;   5-1. Procedure

1. Remove the UV rubber seal from the baseplate edge near the de-capping arms.
2. Move the instrument as close to the left side of the STARlet as possible.
3. Adjust the leveling feet one at a time to raise the instrument until the bottom of the base plate is above the STARlet's desk.
4. Carefully slide the instrument from the left to the right. The flag should not crash with STARlet.
5. Make sure the slots in the base are placed over three carrier guides on each side. Then lower the instrument by tightening the feet until the base plate slightly lands on the deck. Be careful that the third slot with a special fixture and the carrier guide don't collide with each other.
6. Carefully slide the VCMS toward the back.
7. The locating plate lock will slide under the wingnut like below. Once located well, tighten the wingnut to fix the instrument.
8. Make sure VCMS is level. (Refer to replacement instructions to safely disengage chain links if needed)
9. Install the lower enclosure's cosmetic panels. Attach the left and right lower-side panels using two included M4 screws.
10. Attach the rear and from panels using the two included M4 screws. The rear panel will fit over the tabs of the two side panels. The front panel fits over the touchscreen and power switch as well as the tabs in the right and left side panels.
11. Slide the UV rubber seal into place between the STARlet and the edge of the baseplate. It will form a seal along the gap formed by both instruments.
12. The C19 connector power cord connects to the C20 Power socket on the right-hand side of the VCMS.
13. Connect the VCMS to the PC. The RJ45 Ethernet cable connects to the respective port on the right-hand side of the VCMS.
14. Place four drip trays.

2. Then, go to the Network and Sharing Center on the Control Panel of the PC.
3. Click the Change adapter settings tab.
4. Right-click 'Ethernet' and click 'Properties'. Then, select 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click 'Properties'.
5.  Select 'Use the following IP address:' and enter an IP address that is within the same network as the VCMS. The default system IP address is 192.168.100.

    It is recommended that the last 3 digits on the controlling computer be larger than those of the connected hardware.
6. Once the new IP address has been entered, click the 'Subnet mask:' field and it will automatically populate with the correct subnet mask. Then, click 'OK'.



## <mark style="color:blue;">8. Network Connection</mark>
