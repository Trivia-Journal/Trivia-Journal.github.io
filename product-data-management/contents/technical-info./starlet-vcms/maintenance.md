# Maintenance

## <mark style="color:blue;">1. Summary</mark>

Appropriate maintenance is recommended at the following intervals.

* Daily - At the end of the day (by Operator)
* Weekly - At the end of the week (by Operator)
*   Biannual - Preventative maintenance by trained Field Service Engineer. (including the lubrication and calibration).

    If the VCMS runs over 100,000 capping cycles per arm per year, then more frequent maintenance is recommended.

## <mark style="color:blue;">3-1. Procedure - Daily/Weekly Maintenance</mark>

1. Wear appropriate PPE for the laboratory.
2. Make sure the VCMS is powered off.
3.  Apply a disinfectant to a lint-free cloth and wipe down the enclosure and both sides of the front door, de-capping arms, vial clamp mechanism, cap park positions, and base plate.

    Do not apply to electronic components like sensors, touchscreen, or door locks.

    Remove any excess liquid and clean up any spills on the base plate.
4. Wipe down the touchscreen and sensors with a lint-free cloth. A small amount of deionized water can be applied to the cloth if necessary.
5.  (Weekly) Visually, check the vial adapters and the conveyer chain. Tap the gear icon on the touch screen and tap 'Advance Chain' to move the conveyer chain.

    Decontaminate any adapters if necessary.
6.  Test the door lock and door sensor on startup. Power on the instrument and initialize.

    During initialization, pull gently on the load station door to make sure it is locked in place.

    After initialization, make sure no errors appear.

## <mark style="color:blue;">3-2. Procedure - Biannual Maintenance</mark>

1. Perform weekly maintenance. Then, Turn off the instrument.
2.  Apply a disinfectant to a lint-free cloth and clean the chain links in the conveyer chain.

    Inspect the links for damage, debris, or signs of spillage. If any links are damaged, contact Hamilton Technical Support for assistance.
3. Reload the vial adapters. Ensure that all adapters are seated properly in the conveyer chain.
4. Clean the de-capping arms' grippers with a lint-free cloth sprayed with deionized water.
5. Lubricate the gripper joints. Use a small droplet of silicone oil on the end of a lint-free applicator(e.g., Cotton Swab or 50ul tip).
6. Lubricate the following surfaces with Topas Grease.
   * Z-Spindle: Manually, move each de-capping arm to its highest Z height to access their Z-Spindles.
   * Linear Z-Rails: Apply a small amount of grease to the bearing grooves on both sides of both rails, near the top of the rail. When complete, initialize the device to distribute the grease evenly.
   *   Clamp Spindle: Remove the two M3 flange socket screws from the spindle access panel to access the clamp spindle and linear clamp rail.

       Apply a small amount of the Topas Grease near the middle of the spindle.

       Normal use of the VCMS will distribute the grease along the spindle.
   *   Linear Clamp Rail: Apply a small amount of the Topas to either side in the bearing groove using a lint-free applicator, such as a cotton swab or 50ul tip.

       Normal use of the VCMS will distribute the grease along the rail.
7. Power on and initialize the VCMS.
8. Connect to the VCMS using the Service Software and prepare for calibration.
9. Run the vial de-capper calibration routine. Print and sign generated report.
