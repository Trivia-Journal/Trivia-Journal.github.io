### &#x20;   1-1. Unit Affected

**'All-In-One System (AIOS)'**, security design is based on the narrowly-defined its own security ecosystem(which is organized by 'Seegene STARlet', 'CFX96 Dx & C1000', 'SAHS' and 'AIOS Control').&#x20;

That's why **'All-In-One System(AIOS)'** does not have an Application Programming Interface(API) & network point(Port) to interwork with 3rd party.



### &#x20;   1-2. Summary

In order to further utilize the manipulated data, e.g., 'Operating LOG', 'Personal & Patients Info', 'Internal operation command & trigger info.' at the 3rd point, need to use the **Secure Connector & USB that Seegene Inc., supplies** paired to interwork each other.



### &#x20;   1-3. Recommendation

Basically. **Secure Connector & USB** have been packed up with AIOS in order to make sure the prevention and prohibition of indiscriminate actions, i.e., 'Distribution', 'Publish', 'Issuance, 'Edit', 'Reconstitution' without our permission.

**As for the Univeral Key(Secure Connector Removal Tool), it is optional.**

Based on our security design and policy, the action that USB Connector is detached is against our security as a rule. In order to conduct the actions i.e., 'Error Handling', 'Maintenance', and 'Troubleshooting' by the people who have authorization from Seegene Inc., they can detach the USB Connector by using the Secure Connector Removal Tool.

The Secure Connector has been provided, 2EA.

One for the AIOS external USB Port, the other for the external devices i.e., 'User Laptop'.
